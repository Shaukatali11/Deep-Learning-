Scenario 6: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Question: You are training an SVM model to classify images based on pixel intensities. The training process is very slow, 
and the model's performance is suboptimal. How might standardizing the pixel intensity features help?

Analysis:
SVMs rely on the calculation of distances between data points and the hyperplane. If the pixel intensities are not standardized,
features with larger ranges can dominate the distance calculations, leading to a poorly defined hyperplane. Standardizing the 
pixel intensities ensures that the SVM model can find an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, leading 
to faster training and better performance.

Scenario 7: Robust Scaling in the Presence of Outliers
Question: You have a dataset with significant outliers in features like salary and age. You need to standardize the data for 
a machine learning model. Why might you choose robust standardization over traditional standardization?

Analysis:
Traditional standardization uses the mean and standard deviation, which can be significantly affected by outliers. Robust 
standardization, on the other hand, uses the median and interquartile range (IQR), which are less sensitive to outliers. 
This ensures that the transformed features are not disproportionately influenced by extreme values, leading to a more robust 
and reliable model.

Scenario 8: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Regression
Question: You are using KNN to predict house prices based on features like size, number of rooms, and location score. The 
predictions are inconsistent. How could standardizing the features improve the prediction accuracy?

Analysis:
KNN relies on distance calculations to identify the nearest neighbors. If the features have different scales, the feature with 
the largest range (e.g., size) will dominate the distance calculation, leading to biased predictions. Standardizing the 
features ensures that each feature contributes equally to the distance metric, resulting in more accurate and consistent
predictions.

Scenario 9: Time Series Data in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Question: You are using an RNN to forecast stock prices based on historical price data and trading volumes. The model's 
performance is poor. How could standardizing the input features help improve the model?

Analysis:
RNNs are sensitive to the scale of the input features, and unstandardized features can lead to unstable gradients during 
training. This can cause the model to struggle in learning meaningful patterns. Standardizing the input features 
(historical prices and trading volumes) ensures that the RNN can process the data more effectively, leading to improved 
learning and better forecasting performance.

Scenario 10: Feature Engineering and Model Interpretability
Question: You have engineered several new features from raw data for a classification model. Some features have very large 
ranges. How could standardizing these features help in model interpretability and performance?

Analysis:
Engineered features with large ranges can dominate the model, making it difficult to interpret the importance of each feature. 
Standardizing these features ensures that the model coefficients are on a comparable scale, making it easier to interpret 
their relative importance. Additionally, it improves the model's performance by ensuring that all features contribute equally 
to the learning process, leading to more balanced and accurate predictions.
